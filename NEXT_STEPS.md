## 🚀 To Start Your Trading System:

### **Option 1: Easy Start (Recommended)**
```bash
./start_trading_system.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Start**
```bash
# Start bot
python3 yahoo_forex_bot.py &

# Start dashboard
python3 dashboard_server_mac.py &
```

### **Option 3: Just Check Status**
```bash
python3 verify_trade_tracking.py
```

---

## 📊 What to Monitor:

### **Check Trade Status:**
```bash
python3 verify_trade_tracking.py
```
This shows:
- Active trades (pairs currently blocked)
- Cooldown trades (pairs in 4-hour cooldown)
- Completed trades (wins/losses)
- P&L summary

### **View Dashboard:**
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### **Telegram Notifications:**
You'll receive signals as usual, but:
- No contradictory signals anymore
- Each pair can only have 1 active trade
- After trade closes, 4-hour cooldown before next signal

---

## 🎯 What You'll Notice Different:

### **Before Phase A:**
```
19:00 - Up to 10 signals per cycle (bot scans 10 pairs at a time)
19:05 - USD/CHF SHORT signal
19:30 - USD/CHF LONG signal ❌ (contradictory!)
20:00 - EUR/USD SHORT signal
20:05 - EUR/USD LONG signal ❌ (contradictory!)

Note: Bot cycles through all 29 pairs in ~45 minutes
```

### **After Phase A:**
```
19:00 - Up to 10 signals per cycle ✅
       (Each of the 29 pairs can only have 1 active trade)
19:05 - USD/CHF SHORT signal ✅
19:30 - USD/CHF blocked ✅ (active trade exists)
       → Must wait for trade to close
       → Then 4-hour cooldown
       → Then new signals allowed

Note: All 29 pairs tracked, but max 1 active trade per pair
```

## 📱 Telegram Behavior:

You'll still get Telegram notifications, but:
- ✅ Each notification is for a different pair (no duplicates)
- ✅ No contradictory positions
- ✅ Cleaner, more manageable signals

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting:

### **No Signals for Hours?**
**Possible Reasons:**
1. All 29 pairs have active trades (check with `verify_trade_tracking.py`)
2. Pairs are in cooldown periods
3. Markets are closed (weekend/off-hours)
4. Bot stopped running (`ps aux | grep yahoo_forex_bot`)

**Solution:**
- Wait for some trades to close
- Verify bot is running: `./start_trading_system.sh`

### **Trade Not Closing?**
**Possible Reasons:**
1. Price hasn't hit stop or target yet
2. Bot checks every 15 minutes (not instant)

**Solution:**
- Wait for next monitoring cycle
- Check current price vs stop/target
- Run `python3 verify_trade_tracking.py` to see last check time

### **Files Missing?**
**Solution:**
```bash
python3 trade_tracker.py  # Creates files
./start_trading_system.sh  # Restarts everything
```
