# 🎯 FINAL API CREDIT SOLUTION - DEFINITIVE FIX

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The **under/over credit pattern** was caused by:
1. **Rapid-fire API calls** within each symbol scan (3 calls in ~30 seconds)
2. **No gaps between symbols** causing burst usage patterns
3. **Cache misses** forcing unnecessary API calls

## ✅ DEFINITIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### **1. INTER-SYMBOL DELAYS**
- **15-second gap** between each symbol scan
- **Spreads API calls** over time instead of bursts
- **Eliminates the under/over pattern**

### **2. ENHANCED CACHING STRATEGY**
- **D1 data**: 60-minute cache (rarely needs refresh)
- **H4 data**: 30-minute cache (moderate refresh)
- **H1 data**: 15-minute cache (frequent but manageable)

### **3. SMART ROTATION MAINTAINED**
- **ALL 16 major pairs** still covered
- **2 symbols per cycle** = 6 API calls max
- **15-second gaps** = spread over 45+ seconds per cycle

## 📊 EXPECTED TwelveData RESULTS

### **Before Fix:**
- **Pattern**: Under/Over/Under/Over (6-9 credits)
- **Minutely maximum**: 9/8 (over limit)
- **Graph**: Spiky, unpredictable bursts

### **After Fix:**
- **Pattern**: Consistent, smooth usage
- **Minutely maximum**: ≤6/8 (safely under limit)
- **Graph**: Even bars, no spikes

## ⏱️ NEW TIMING STRUCTURE

**Per Scan Cycle:**
```
Symbol 1: API call 1 → wait 8.6s → API call 2 → wait 8.6s → API call 3
         ↓ 15-second inter-symbol delay
Symbol 2: API call 4 → wait 8.6s → API call 5 → wait 8.6s → API call 6

Total time per cycle: ~75 seconds
Total API calls: 6 (well under 8/minute limit)
```
