## ‚ö†Ô∏è Telegram Notifications: **NEEDS SETUP**

Your Telegram bot is not configured yet. Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram app
2. Search for `@BotFather`
3. Send the command: `/newbot`
4. Follow instructions:
   - Give your bot a name (e.g., "My Trading Bot")
   - Give it a username (e.g., "my_trading_signals_bot")
5. **BotFather will give you a TOKEN** - copy it!
   - It looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmnoPQRstuVWXyz`

### Step 2: Get Your Chat ID

1. Search for your bot on Telegram (the username you created)
2. Click "Start" or send any message to it
3. Open this URL in your browser (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token):
   ```
   https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN/getUpdates
   ```
4. Look for `"chat":{"id":` followed by a number
5. That number is your CHAT_ID (e.g., `123456789`)

### Step 3: Update Your .env File

Edit the file: `/Users/andrewbuck/Desktop/Trading Bot/.env`

Replace these lines:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
```

With your actual values:
```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGhIJKlmnoPQRstuVWXyz
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

### Step 4: Test Your Setup

Run this command:
```bash
cd "/Users/andrewbuck/Desktop/Trading Bot"
python3 test_telegram_simple.py
```

If successful, you'll receive a test message on Telegram!
