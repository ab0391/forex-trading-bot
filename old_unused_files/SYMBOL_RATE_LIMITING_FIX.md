# üéØ SYMBOL-LEVEL RATE LIMITING FIX

## üö® PROBLEM DIAGNOSED

**Root Cause**: Bot scans 5 symbols √ó 4 API calls each = **20 API calls per cycle**
- This creates 6+ credit spikes despite per-call rate limiting
- TwelveData limit: 8 calls/minute
- Current usage: 20 calls in ~2-3 minutes = averaging 7-10 calls/minute

## üìä CURRENT PATTERN ANALYSIS

**Big Spikes (6 credits)**: Full scan cycle
- EUR/USD: 4 calls (D1, H4, H1, current price)
- GBP/USD: 4 calls 
- USD/JPY: 4 calls
- AUD/USD: 4 calls  
- USD/CHF: 4 calls
- **Total: 20 calls** = 6+ credits

**Small Spikes (1 credit)**: Partial operations or current price checks

## üõ†Ô∏è SOLUTION OPTIONS

### **Option 1: IMMEDIATE FIX - Reduce Symbols**
```python
# Change from:
self.symbols = ["EUR/USD", "GBP/USD", "USD/JPY", "AUD/USD", "USD/CHF"]

# To:
self.symbols = ["EUR/USD", "GBP/USD"]  # Only 2 symbols = 8 calls max
```
**Result**: 2 symbols √ó 4 calls = 8 calls = EXACTLY the limit

### **Option 2: SMART SOLUTION - Symbol Rotation**
```python
# Rotate through symbols across scan cycles
def get_symbols_for_scan(self):
    all_symbols = ["EUR/USD", "GBP/USD", "USD/JPY", "AUD/USD", "USD/CHF"]
    symbols_per_cycle = 2  # Maximum 2 symbols per scan
    
    # Rotate starting position
    start_idx = (self.scan_count * symbols_per_cycle) % len(all_symbols)
    return all_symbols[start_idx:start_idx + symbols_per_cycle]
```

### **Option 3: OPTIMAL SOLUTION - Enhanced Caching + Staggered Timing**
```python
# Scan symbols one at a time with larger gaps
for symbol in self.symbols:
    # Process one symbol completely
    self.scan_single_symbol(symbol)
    
    # Wait 1-2 minutes before next symbol
    if not self.shutdown_requested:
        time.sleep(120)  # 2 minute gap between symbols
```

## üéØ RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION

**PHASE 1: Immediate Relief (Option 1)**
- Reduce to 2 symbols temporarily
- Verify credit usage drops to exactly 8/minute

**PHASE 2: Smart Enhancement (Option 2 + 3)**
- Implement symbol rotation system
- Add enhanced caching for frequently used data
- Spread symbol processing across time

## üìà EXPECTED RESULTS

### **After Phase 1 (2 symbols)**:
- **Minutely maximum**: 8/8 (exactly at limit)
- **Graph pattern**: Consistent 2-credit bars
- **No red spikes**: All usage under limit

### **After Phase 2 (enhanced system)**:
- **All 5 symbols scanned**: But spread across multiple cycles
- **Minutely maximum**: ‚â§7/8 (safely under limit)  
- **Better coverage**: More frequent but smaller scans

## üöÄ IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

1. **Quick Fix**: Deploy 2-symbol version immediately
2. **Monitor**: Verify credit usage drops to acceptable levels
3. **Enhance**: Implement rotation system for full symbol coverage
4. **Optimize**: Add intelligent caching for repeated data requests

This approach will eliminate the credit spikes while maintaining trading effectiveness.
